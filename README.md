                                           ---- Overview ----
The system was designed as a web -based app for managing appointments and reservations using a user friendly interface. 
Please refer to the demo website at www.mbbtech.com.au

 

                                            ---- Background ----
The system development was originally developed as way for me to gain more practical experience with PHP programming.
The application was was designed from scratch without the dependence of a CMS or other library modules.
I progressively added more features, such as database functionality and user interface, as I come to learn more about web technolonies.
The front-end is developed in HTML, CSS & JavaScript, while the server side (back-end) uses PHP and MySQL. 

                                           
 
                                              ---- System Features----
The system comes with a custom Control Panel (CP), see a demostration at www.mbbtech.com.au/#system_configuration
The SMS component was developed seperate module. It was originally developed in Java, which run as an Android app. I later developed a native windows app in C that used a GSM module for sending SMS.To get an idea of how to send SMS from a GSM module, please refer to my blog article -http://blog.mbbtech.com.au/#automation1.


                                          
                                            ---- Improvements ----
The project was developed back in 2012 when I had just started to learning about web programming. Through the experience I gained confidence in my coding capabilities, and learned about the principles of software development (the hard way!)
If I was to do this project over again, I would place improve my code by taking take a more object oriented design approach(especially with PHP) and commenting the code.
