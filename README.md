-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           
                                           
### Introduction
The system was implemented as a web-based app for managing oline appointments and reservations, please refer to the [demo website](http:\\mbbtech.com.au).

 

### Background
The project was originally developed as a practical way for learning web development. This was also an opportunity to gain hands-on practical programming experience with PHP, JavaScript and MySQL.

The application was was designed from scratch without the dependence of a CMS or library modules.
Through the project development stages, more features inclunding SMS functionlity and a user-freindly admin control panel, were progrssively added.

                                           
 
### System Features
The system comes with a custom Control Panel (CP) for customising the system feautures, please refer to the [CP demo](http://mbbtech.com.au/#system_configuration)
The SMS component was developed as a seperate module.

It was originally developed in Java, which run as an Android app. The SMS componet was later re-developed as a native windows app in C using a GSM module.
To get an idea on how to send SMS from a GSM module, please refer to the blog article [Remote Automation Using GSM](http://blog.mbbtech.com.au/#automation1).


                                          
### Improvements 
The project was developed back in 2012 when I had just started learning  web programming. Through the experience I gained confidence in my coding capabilities, and learned about the principles of software development (the hard way!)

If I was to do this project over again, I would  improve my code by taking take a more object oriented design approach (especially with PHP), and commenting the code.
