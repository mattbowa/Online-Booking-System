### Introduction
A demo of the project website can be found [here](http://www.booking.mbowa.net/). The system comes with a user-freindly admin control panel for customising the system feautures, please refer to the [System Control Panel ](http://www.booking.mbowa.net/#system_configuration).
 The projet full source code can be downloade on [github](https://github.com/mattbowa/booking).




 

### Background
The project was originally developed as a practical way for learning web development. This was also an opportunity to gain hands-on practical programming experience with PHP, JavaScript and MySQL.

The application was designed from scratch, with HTML5 and CSS, without the dependence of a CMS or library modules.

Through the project development stages, more features inclunding front & server side and database functionlities  were progrssively added.

The SMS component was developed as a seperate module in Java, which run as an Android app. The SMS componet was later re-developed as a native windows app in C using a GSM module.

                                           
 
### System Features

                                          
### Improvements 
The project was developed back in 2012 when I had just started learning  web programming. Through the experience, I gained confidence in my coding capabilities,  gianed practical experience with the principles of software development, and learned of the importance of using a version control system (the hard way!).

If I was to do this project over again, I would  improve my code by taking take a more object oriented design approach (especially with PHP), and commenting the code.     
**Please note that support for this system has been discontinued**
