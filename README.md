### Introduction

The system was implemented as a web-based app for managing oline appointments and reservations. 
		 I designed the system with the idea of providing  a free service where clients can make appointments online.
		 The system comes with a ton of useful cumstomisable features inclunding SMS remainders.<br />
The system comes with a user-freindly admin control panel for customising the system feautures, please refer to the [System Control Panel ](http://www.booking.mbowa.net/#system_configuration).

### Background
The project was originally developed as a practical way for learning web development. This was also an opportunity to gain hands-on practical programming experience with PHP, JavaScript and MySQL.<br />

<!--The app was designed developed from scratch ( PHP, JavaScript & MySQL) without the dependence of a CMS, libraries or frameworks.-->

Through the project development stages more features, including front & server side functionalities,  were progressively added.<br />

The SMS component was developed as a seperate module in Java, which run as an Android app. The SMS componet was later re-developed in C as a native windows using a GSM module.

### Website
A project website has been moved [here](http://www.booking.mbowa.net/).
